# Travel Hacking Toolkit

AI-powered travel hacking with points, miles, and award flights. Drop-in skills and MCP servers for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).

Ask your AI to find you a 60,000-mile business class flight to Tokyo. It'll search award availability across 25+ programs, compare against cash prices, check your loyalty balances, and tell you the best play.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borski/travel-hacking-toolkit.git
cd travel-hacking-toolkit

# macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
./scripts/setup.sh

# Windows (PowerShell or cmd)
.\scripts\setup.cmd
```

The setup script walks you through everything: picks your tool (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, or all three), creates your API key config files, installs dependencies, installs the Codex plugin when selected, and optionally installs skills system-wide for OpenCode and Claude Code.

On Windows the `.cmd` wrapper launches `scripts\setup.ps1` with an ExecutionPolicy bypass so nothing needs to be unblocked first. You can also run the PowerShell script directly: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup.ps1`.

The 5 free MCP servers (Skiplagged, Kiwi, Trivago, Ferryhopper, Airbnb) work immediately with zero API keys. For the full experience, add at minimum:

| Key | Why | Free Tier |
|-----|-----|-----------|
| `SEATS_AERO_API_KEY` | Award flight search. The main event. | No (Pro ~$8/mo) |
| `DUFFEL_API_KEY_LIVE` | Primary cash flight prices. Real GDS data. | Yes (search free, pay per booking) |
| `IGNAV_API_KEY` | Secondary cash flight prices. Fast REST API. | Yes (1,000 free requests) |

Six skills run as optional Docker containers (Southwest, American Airlines, Chase, Amex, TicketsAtWork, plus a shared base image). `setup.sh` auto-pulls them when you select the relevant tools. See the [Docker Images](#docker-images) section for the full catalog and usage examples.

Then launch your tool:

```bash
# OpenCode
opencode

# Claude Code
claude --strict-mcp-config --mcp-config .mcp.json

# Codex
source .env && codex
```

The `--strict-mcp-config` flag tells Claude Code to load MCP servers from the config file directly. This is more reliable than auto-discovery ([known issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5037)).

For Codex, `./scripts/setup.sh` installs a local plugin symlink at `~/.codex/plugins/travel-hacking-toolkit` and adds a marketplace entry at `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The plugin exposes the repo's `skills/` directory and the travel MCP servers as one installable bundle.

| **lessons-learned** | Hard-won knowledge from real searches. The mandatory Seats.aero workflow, Southwest specifics, Companion Pass math, source accuracy, small-market caveats, Duffel limitations. Load before any award flight search. |
| **partner-awards** | Which programs ticket which airlines (alliance + bilateral). Cross-references credit card currencies to booking programs. Reachability workflow. |
| **points-valuations** | CPP formula, floor/ceiling rules, surcharge-heavy programs to avoid, transfer bonus considerations, Chase Points Boost dynamics, opportunity cost. |
<!-- END: readme:reference -->

## Docker Images

Six skills run as Docker containers (browser-automated via Patchright). All images are public on GitHub Container Registry, no auth required to pull. `setup.sh` (and `setup.ps1` on Windows) auto-pulls the ones you need based on which tool you select.

<!-- BEGIN: readme:docker -->

### Building Locally

To build any image locally instead of pulling from ghcr.io:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/borski/<image-name>:local skills/<skill-name>/
```

The `Dockerfile` in each skill directory shows exactly what's in the image. All five skill images build on `ghcr.io/borski/patchright-docker` as the base.

## How It Works

### Skills

Skills are markdown files that give your AI specialized travel-hacking capabilities. They come in two flavors:

- **Tool skills** (`duffel`, `seats-aero`, `southwest`, etc.) wrap APIs, browser automation, and external tools. They contain endpoint documentation, curl examples, useful jq filters, and step-by-step usage instructions.
- **Reference skills** (`flight-search-strategy`, `points-valuations`, `alliances`, `lessons-learned`, etc.) carry the institutional knowledge that decides when and how to use the tool skills. They contain the workflow rules, lookup tables, and hard-won lessons that prevent common mistakes.

OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex can all load them. Skills use **progressive disclosure**: each one's name and short description are loaded into context at session start. The agent reads the full SKILL.md only when it decides to use a skill. This keeps the always-loaded context small and lets the toolkit grow without bloating the agent's prompt.

The `skills/` directory is the canonical source. The setup script either:
- Installs a Codex plugin that points at the repo's skills and MCP config
- Copies them to your tool's global skills directory (`~/.config/opencode/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`)
- Or creates project-level symlinks so they load when you work from this directory

### MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give your AI real-time tools it can call directly. The configs are in:
- `opencode.json` for OpenCode (auto-discovered from the repo root)
- `.mcp.json` for Claude Code (auto-discovered from the repo root)
- `plugins/travel-hacking-toolkit/.mcp.json` for Codex plugin installs

Skiplagged, Kiwi.com, Trivago, Ferryhopper, and Airbnb need no setup at all. LiteAPI is also a remote server but needs an API key configured in your settings.

**Why Codex needs a plugin:** OpenCode and Claude Code both auto-discover MCP servers from a repo-local config file. Codex doesn't. It only loads MCP servers from `~/.codex/config.toml` or from an installed plugin. The toolkit ships a Codex plugin (under `plugins/travel-hacking-toolkit/`) that bundles the MCP config so Codex users get the same out-of-the-box experience as the other two tools. `setup.sh` wires this up automatically when you select the Codex option.

## Which Skill Do I Use?

```
"Plan a trip to Paris"
  └─→ trip-planner (runs everything below automatically)

"Find flights SFO to CDG"
  ├─ Know exact dates? → compare-flights (all sources in parallel)
  └─ Flexible dates?   → award-calendar (cheapest dates for a route)

"Find hotels in Paris"
  ├─ Best overall      → compare-hotels (portals + metasearch + Airbnb)
  ├─ Premium programs  → premium-hotels (FHR/THC/Edit)
  └─ Discount pricing  → ticketsatwork (often beats portals 10-30%)

"Should I use points or cash?"
  └─→ trip-calculator (CPP analysis + opportunity cost)
      Reference: points-valuations (floor/ceiling rules)

"Which of my points should I use?"
  └─→ transfer-partners (cheapest transfer path)
      Reference: partner-awards (cross-alliance reachability)

"Why is this redemption flagged as poor value?"
  └─→ Reference skills: points-valuations, alliances, award-sweet-spots

"Why am I not finding award space?"
  └─→ lessons-learned (THE mandatory Seats.aero workflow rules)

"A tool failed. Now what?"
  └─→ fallback-and-resilience (per-tool recovery paths)

"How do I actually book this?"
  └─→ booking-guidance (booking flow, phone numbers, hold-before-transfer rule)

"Check my SW reservations for price drops"
  └─→ southwest (change flight monitor)
```

The **orchestration skills** (`trip-planner`, `compare-flights`, `compare-hotels`) call the individual source skills automatically. Start with those unless you need a specific source.

The **reference skills** (`flight-search-strategy`, `points-valuations`, `partner-awards`, `alliances`, `award-sweet-spots`, `cabin-codes`, `hotel-chains`, `fallback-and-resilience`, `booking-guidance`, `lessons-learned`) auto-load on relevant context to provide deep institutional knowledge without you needing to invoke them explicitly.

## The Travel Hacking Workflow

The core question: **"Should I burn points or pay cash?"**

1. **Search ALL flight sources** — Duffel + Ignav + Google Flights + Skiplagged + Kiwi for cash. Seats.aero for awards. Southwest for SW points. Chase + Amex portals for pay-with-points.
2. **Optimize transfers** — `transfer-partners` finds the cheapest path from your credit card points to the loyalty program offering the best deal.
3. **Compare** — `trip-calculator` shows CPP for each option. Higher CPP = better use of points. Below floor valuation = pay cash instead.
4. **Check balances** — AwardWallet confirms you have enough points.
5. **Book it** — Use booking links from Seats.aero, Duffel, or Ignav. Don't transfer points until you've confirmed availability on the airline's site.

### Example Prompts

```
"Plan a trip to Paris Aug 11-15 in business class"
"Find me the cheapest business class award from SFO to Tokyo in August"
"When's the cheapest time to fly SFO to NRT on points?"
"Compare all options for SFO to CDG round trip"
"Find hotels in Stockholm, include Airbnb"
"Compare points vs cash for a round trip JFK to London next March"
"What are my United miles and Chase UR balances?"
"Check my Southwest reservations for price drops"
"Find hidden gems near Lisbon"
"How do I get from Oslo to Bergen by train?"
"What's the seat pitch on Air France 83 in business class?"
"How many AAdvantage miles do I have?"
"Which FHR and Chase Edit hotels are in Stockholm? Any stacking opportunities?"
"What's the Points Boost rate for SFO to Tokyo business class on Chase?"
"Compare Amex IAP fares vs cash for business class to Paris"
```

## Smoke Testing

After any change to skills, CLAUDE.md, or MCP config, run the three-way smoke test:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-test.sh           # full test (static + all 3 agents, ~3-5 min)
bash scripts/smoke-test.sh --quick   # static checks only (no agent invocations)
bash scripts/smoke-test.sh --agents  # agent invocations only
```

What it verifies:
1. `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` syntax parse cleanly
2. Every skill has valid `name` + `description` frontmatter
3. CLAUDE.md is under Claude Code's 40k char warning threshold
4. All Docker images exist on ghcr.io
5. All data files are within their declared TTL
6. README.md and llms.txt skill tables match the generated output (no drift)
7. Each agent (codex, claude, opencode) starts cleanly from the toolkit
8. Each agent picks the right skills (`lessons-learned` + `flight-search-strategy` minimum) for a real travel question

Missing CLIs are skipped, not failed. Run from the repo root.

### Skill Table Generation

The skill tables in this README and `llms.txt` are auto-generated from each skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The fields used:

- `name` — required, the skill identifier
- `category` — required, one of: `orchestration`, `flights`, `portals`, `hotels`, `loyalty`, `destinations`, `reference`
- `summary` — required, the one-liner shown in tables and llms.txt
- `api_key` — optional, short text for the API Key column (e.g., `Duffel`, `None (free)`)
- `docker_image` — optional, full image name like `ghcr.io/borski/sw-fares` if the skill ships a Docker image

To add a new skill, edit `scripts/skill-meta.tsv` and run:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-skill-frontmatter.py   # apply TSV to SKILL.md frontmatter
bash scripts/gen-skill-tables.sh            # regenerate README + llms.txt
```

Drift between the source (frontmatter / TSV) and the generated tables is caught by `smoke-test.sh`, which fails if running `--check` would produce a diff. This makes drift a CI failure, not a silent issue.
